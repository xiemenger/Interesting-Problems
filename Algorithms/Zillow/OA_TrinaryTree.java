/**
 * Question 2) Implement insert and delete in a tri-nary tree. 
 * A tri-nary tree is much like a binary tree but with three child nodes 
 * for each parent instead of two -- with the left node being values
less than the parent, the right node values greater than the parent, 
and the middle nodes values 
equal to the parent.
For example, suppose I added the following nodes to the tree in this 
order: 5, 4, 9, 5, 7, 2, 2. 
The resulting tree would look like this:
    5
  / | \
4  5   9
/      /
2     7
|
2
