Process 
is an executing instance of application.

Thread:
is a path of execution within a process.

Typical difference:
1) A process can contain multiple threads. 
2) Threads of the same process run in a shared memory space.
   while process run in separate memory spaces.

太多的thread会有什么不好?
hurts performance.
 1) 如果每个thread的work太少, 那么starting and terminating
    thread swamps the useful work.
  2) 如果thread share finite hardware resource. 

Typical difference is, 
: 1) processes run in separated memory while threads run in shared memory.
processes are typically independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process
2) processes carry considerably more state information than threads, whereas multiple threads 
within a process share process state as well as memory and other resources
3) processes have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space
processes interact only through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms
4) ontext switching between threads in the same process is typically faster than context 
switching between processes.
