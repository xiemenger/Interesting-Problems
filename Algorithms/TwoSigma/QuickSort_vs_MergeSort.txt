Quicksort vs Merge sort
Quick sort
- in place
- average O(nlgn), worst O(n^2)

Merge sort
- average and worst O(nlgn)
- extra space O(n)

External sorting is a term for a class of sorting algorithms that 
can handle massive amounts of data. External sorting is required when the data 
being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM) 
and instead they must reside in the slower external memory (usually a hard drive). 
External sorting typically uses a hybrid sort-merge strategy. In the sorting phase, 
chunks of data small enough to fit in main memory are read, sorted, and written out 
to a temporary file. In the merge phase, the sorted subfiles are combined into a single 
larger file.

The core idea, is that in the sorting phrase, the chunk of data that we need to sort 
could be loaded to RAM and thus apply sorting to them. Then we can write them back to 
the temporary file.

Both merge sort and quick sort could be used for external sorting.
