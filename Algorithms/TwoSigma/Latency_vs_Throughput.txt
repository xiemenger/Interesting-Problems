Latency: Elasped Time for an event.
         比如我从office走到办公室需要30分钟, 那么30分钟就是这个
         event的latency.

Throughput:
       Events per unit time. 
       比如一段时间内有多少人走进教室.
       Bandwidth: ThroughPut measure.

Throughput impacted by latency?
throughput = bandwith / rtt
rtt = latency * 2

latency up, throughput down
latency down, throughput up
